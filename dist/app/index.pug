      article
        p The 2018 Fast Stream Conference, Understanding Britain, will enable Fast Streamers to create tangible change in the Civil Service, ensuring our work is informed by a two-way conversation with the people that we serve. 
        p As Fast Streamers, we need to champion the diverse needs of the UK population in our work. We’ll explore whether the population believes that public services truly serve them, how data and technology is changing the work of Government and how we can break out of the “Whitehall bubble”. 
        p On February 15th and 16th, Understanding Britain will equip Fast Streamers with the knowledge and skills required to listen to the public we serve, challenge our assumptions, engage ordinary people and deliver services that reflect the concerns of the public.
